```
Although I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,â€”a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.

**Main Events in Oliver Twist's Birth**

1. Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse, which the narrator suggests was actually fortunate for him despite workhouses being generally undesirable places.

2. Oliver had severe difficulty breathing at birth and struggled to begin respiration, which is described as a troublesome but necessary practice for survival.

3. The newborn lay gasping on a small mattress, hovering between life and death, with death appearing more likely than survival at that moment.
